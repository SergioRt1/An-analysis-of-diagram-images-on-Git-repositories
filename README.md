# An analysis of diagram images on Git repositories

This project contains a practical implementation of the research paper found at [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/abstract=4474674). It provides multiple tools designed to extract and process data from Git repositories, thereby assisting in repository mining tasks. Apart from its primary purpose, these tools can be used independently for new investigations and research purposes.

## Instructions

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for the project. You can find more information on how to do this in the Python  [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

```
python -m venv ML-env
```

Next, install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. Ensure that you have the correct version of TensorFlow installed, as per your CPU architecture

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training notebook

The Jupyter notebook provided guides you through the process of training a convolutional neural network for image classification. The training process involves applying transfer learning techniques with fine-tuning.

## Prediction notebook

The prediction notebook illustrates the batch prediction process for large datasets.

## Git clone

This module facilitates the cloning and extraction of information from multiple Git repositories. While we have used the Lindholmen and GHTorrent datasets, you can modify the code to adapt to any CSV containing a list of repositories.

## Labeler

The Labeler module serves as a useful tool for labelling images within a dataset. With the help of the OpenCV library, every image in a folder can be displayed, and you can input any key on the keyboard to assign the corresponding category to that image.

## Scrapper

The Scraper is a tool that utilizes Selenium to search for images on Google Images and download them to your local desktop. Specify the search term within the script and run it.

```
python scrapper/scrapper.py
```

## Normalizer

This normalizer script pre-processes images. The output images are in RGB format with dimensions of 224x224 pixels. The images are named according to a hash generated from the image content.

```
python scrapper/normalizer.py
```

## Validator

The Validator is a script that checks the quality of the predictions generated by the prediction notebook.

```
python csv/validator.py
```
